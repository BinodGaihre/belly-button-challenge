# belly-button-challenge
- This project is about building an interactive dashboard to explore the dataset, which catalogs the microbes that
colonize human navels.
- samples.json file is the dataset we used to build this project.
- index.html is the html file through which we can see the dashboard we build.
- app.js is the JavaScript file that has the main code to build the dash board.
